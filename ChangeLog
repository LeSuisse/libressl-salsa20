Because this project is maintained both in the OpenBSD tree using CVS and in
Git, it can be confusing following all of the changes.

Most of the libssl and libcrypto source code is is here in OpenBSD CVS:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/

Some of the libcrypto and OS-compatibility files for entropy and random number
generation are here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libcrypto/

A new simplified SSL wrapper library is here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libressl/

The LibreSSL Portable project copies these portions of the OpenBSD tree, along
with relevant portions of the C library, to a Git repository. This makes it
easier to follow all of the relevant changes to the upstream project in a
single place:

	https://github.com/libressl-portable/openbsd/commits/master

The portable bits of the project are largely maintained out-of-tree, and their
history is also available from Git.
